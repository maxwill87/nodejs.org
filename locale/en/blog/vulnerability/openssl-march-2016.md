The OpenSSL project has [announced](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2016-February/000063.html) that that they will be releasing versions 1.0.2g and 1.0.1s this week, on **Tuesday the 1st of March, UTC**. The releases will fix _"several defects"_ that are labelled as _"high"_ severity under their security policy, meaning they are:

> ... issues that are of a lower risk than critical, perhaps due to affecting less common configurations, or which are less likely to be exploitable.

Node.js v0.10 and v0.12 both use OpenSSL v1.0.1 and Node.js v4 and v5 both use OpenSSL v1.0.2 and releases from nodejs.org and some other popular distribution sources are statically compiled. Therefore, all active release lines are impacted by this update.

At this stage, due to embargo, it is uncertain the exact nature of these defects, nor what impact they will have on Node.js users, if any.

As we already had minor, non-security releases scheduled for each of our active release lines during this week and next, we will be adjusting our schedule to adapt to the OpenSSL releases depending on their impact on Node.js users.

We will therefore proceed as follows:

Within approximately 24 hours of the OpenSSL releases, our crypto team will make an impact assessment for Node.js users of the OpenSSL releases. This information may vary depending for the different active release lines and will be posted here.

As part of that impact assessment we will announce our release plans for each of the active release lines to take into account any impact. **Please be prepared for the possibility of important updates to Node.js v0.10, v0.12, v4 and v5 soon after Tuesday, the 1st of March.**

### Node.js v0.10 (Maintenance)

A release of Node.js v0.10.43 has been proposed for this week, it currently contains fixes for domains and an important fix for a regression in http_parser that was introduced in v0.10.42. Details of the changes included in this release along with instructions on how to download and use a release candidate (v0.10.43-rc.1) can be found in <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5404>. Node.js v0.10 users are encouraged to test the release candidate build to ensure compatibility with existing deployments.

If the OpenSSL 1.0.1s release contains important fixes that impact Node.js v0.10 we will endeavour to ensure that our v0.10.43 release contains the update.

### Node.js v0.12 (LTS)

A release of Node.js v0.12.11 has been proposed for this week, it currently contains fixes for domains, an important fix for a regression in http_parser that was introduced in v0.12.10, and some other minor fixes. Details of the changes included in this release along with instructions on how to download and use a release candidate (v0.12.11-rc.1) can be found in <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5403>. Node.js v0.12 users are encouraged to test the release candidate build to ensure compatibility with existing deployments.

If the OpenSSL 1.0.1s release contains important fixes for Node.js v0.12 we will endevour to ensure that our v0.12.11 release contains the update.

### Node.js v4 (LTS "Argon")

A significant update to Node.js v4 has been proposed for next week, the 8th of March. You can read about what will be included in Node.js v4.4.0 and find release candidates to test against your deployments at <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5301>.

If the OpenSSL 1.0.2g update includes important fixes that impact Node.js v4, we may release a v4.3.2 _this week_ with only the security updates in order to provide a low-risk path for Node.js v4 users.

If the OpenSSL 1.0.2g update _does not include_ important fixes that impact Node.js v4, we will continue with our planned v4.4.0 release and also attempt to include the OpenSSL 1.0.2g upgrade. Users of Node.js v4 can then upgrade to v4.4.0 in their own time and allow for proper testing of the changes included.

### Node.js v5 (Stable)

A regular update to Node.js v5 has been proposed for this week. You can read about what will be included in the proposed Node.js v5.7.1 at <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5464>. We are excluding any semver-minor changes from this release although it has fixes for some regressions 

If the OpenSSL 1.0.2g release contains important fixes for Node.js v5, we will endevour to ensure that our v5.7.1 release contains the update.

### Summary

* Expect an impact assessment of the OpenSSL updates within 24 hours of their release
* Expect releases of Node.js v0.10, v0.12 and v5 this week, possibly containing important security releases
* Expect a Node.js v4.4.0 release next with the possibility of a v4.3.2 security update this week
